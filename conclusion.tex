\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we presented a new approach for PDDL+ planning that can handle the whole set of PDDL+ features, respecting Fox and Longâ€™s semantics.
The approach we proposed is an SMT encoding of PDDL+ domains that correctly captures the must semantics of PDDL+, which constrains how processes and events interact with each other and with actions. The encoding is general and can be used with any SMT solver in the theory of quantifier-free nonlinear arithmetic.
Experimental results show that the approach dramatically outperforms existing work in finding plans for solvable problems, and it is efficient also in proving plan-non-existence.
